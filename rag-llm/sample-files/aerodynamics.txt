Boundary layer control, achieved using suction or blowing methods, can significantly reduce the aerodynamic drag on an aircraft's wing surface.The yaw angle of an aircraft, indicative of its side-to-side motion, is crucial for stability and is controlled primarily by the rudder.With advancements in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), engineers can accurately predict the turbulent airflow patterns around complex aircraft geometries, optimizing their design for better performance.
